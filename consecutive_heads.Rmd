# Consecutive heads

## Subject

What is the expected number of (fair) coin flips to get three consecutive heads? What about $n$ consecutive heads?

## Answer

### First part

The first part is quite easy, and can be done without Markov Chain knowledge.

Let us note $N$ the random variable of the number of trials to get three consecutive heads. We have

$$\mathbb E[N]=\frac12\left(1+\mathbb E[N]\right)+\frac14\left(2+\mathbb E[N]\right)+\frac18\left(3+\mathbb E[N]\right)+\frac38.$$

Which leads us to $\mathbb E[N]=14$.
