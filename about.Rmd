Hi! I'm Antoine Falck.

I'm a quant with particular interest in algorithmic trading and asset management. My interests include: math, programming, Linux and soccer (jetzt geht's los).

The initial purpose of this blog is a place to collect various spare-time projects I’ve worked on, that might be of interest to other people. We’ll see how it evolves from here.

Thanks for stoping by! Hope you're having fun.

## Professional

I'm employed by Kepler Cheuvreux in Paris in the quant research team. You can see my [resume](./files/resume.pdf) for more details.
